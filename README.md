# Hi there! 👋

## About Me 🚀 

👨‍🎓 I am **Hamza Elhaj**, a **Data Scientist** (specializing in Machine Learning) and currently pursuing my PhD in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** at **Anglia Ruskin University**.

🤖 I am passionate about dealing with data and love learning new topics in data science. I love to explore more techniques in machine learning and data science. It is all I talk about these days. 🧐 I'm curious about what's new in this field. I would love to hear from you 👐.

📗 I love reading books on **personal development** and **leadership**. My favourite ones are **Who Moved My Cheese?** by _Spencer Johnson_, and **It’s Ok Not To Be Ok** by _Claire Chamberlain_.

Outside the world of tech, I love spending my free time with family 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 watching and playing soccer ⚽ practising chess ♟️ and workout 💪.
